                    <p>Succulents are very hardy plants that store water in their leaves. They thrive in dry climates,
                        dislike
                        high humidity and are capable of surviving in periods of drought thanks to their ability to
                        store water.
                        However, too much water will cause the plant to die if left for too long.

                        An amazing quality of succulents is their ability to propagate easily. While some species
                        propagate more
                        easily than others, many can grow new plants from a leaf that has fallen off the plant.</p>
